					<h5><q>In an information-rich world, the wealth of information means a dearth of something else: a scarcity of whatever it is that information consumes. What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance of information sources that might consume it.</q> — <a href="https://digitalcollections.library.cmu.edu/awweb/awarchive?type=file&item=33748">Simon, H.

We performed a large-scale empirical study of 169 Q&A sites in <a href="https://stackexchange.com/">StackExchange</a> platform, and examined disceconomies of scale—the ratio of answers to questions (Econ. Ratio) declining with the increase in number of users. The opposite of diseconomies is economies, when the ratio increases with the increase in number of users. Most sites in StackExchange exhibit diseconomies of scale, whereas a few exhibit economies. We found that an adaptation of well-known <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobb%E2%80%93Douglas_production_function">Cobb-Douglas</a> model well describes the empirical trends of economies and diseconomies. In the Figure below, we present the economies and diseconomies of scale in three StackExchange sites: SUPERUSER–strong diseconomies, PUZZLING–weak economies, CSTHEORY–strong economies.</h5>

					<h5><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User-generated_content">Content</a> (post, comment, blog, wiki, photo, video, etc.) production and subsequent consumption is a key part of the social web experience. Every second, on average, several thousand tweets are tweeted on Twitter, which corresponds to several hundred million tweets per day and several hundred billion tweets per year. The content generation stats are in similar scale for other massive social media platforms such as Facebook and YouTube (Visit <a href="https://www.internetlivestats.com">Internet Live Stats</a> for more such stats). We continue to witness the post-Web 2.0 era in the light of these social media platforms, where content production and consumption are the core processes that keep the platforms <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.04477.pdf">alive</a> by serving <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DurreeforAoIRFinal.pdf">nowness</a> in the social web experience.</h5>

					<h5>While content production and consumption are core processes that drive the social media platforms, our understanding of these processes and their relationship is yet limited. For example–What factors drive the production and consumption processes in a social media platform? Is it simply user participation, implying participation of more users lead to more production and consumption? Given that the users have limited time and they are distributing their time across production and consumption activities (e.g., In Facebook, a user may distribute time between writing his/her own posts and comments, and reading posts and comments from friends), what can be inferred about the relationship between production and consumption? Further, if users are investing most of their time in consumption activities (say reading posts and comments), or conversely, in production activities (say generating posts and comments), how does it affect the platform's <a href="https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/isre.12.4.346.9703">sustainability</a>, specifically in terms of future production and consumption?</h5>

					<h5>To date, sustainability of social media platforms has been studied mainly from the perspective of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1307.1354.pdf">user growth</a>. These studies, however, only concentrate on the interaction between users, pay little or no attention to the interaction between users and contents, and therefore, can not reveal insights regarding content production and consumption. There is a recent body of empirical studies that analyze <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.153.8605&rep=rep1&type=pdf">patterns</a> of user content production to reveal useful insights. However, even with these production-specific insights, there is a <q>gap</q> in understanding the factors of production and consumption, and their relationship. What is missing from the picture is explanatory models that clearly establish the relationship between production (or consumption) and associated factors. Developing such models is important for understanding the content production and consumption processes, predicting future production and consumption, and identifying platforms that will sustain for a long period of time.</h5>

					<h5>In this project, we interpret the community question answering websites on the StackExchange platform as knowledge markets, and analyze how and why these markets can fail at scale. A knowledge market framing allows site operators to reason about market failures, and to design policies to prevent them. Our goal is to provide insights on large-scale knowledge market failures through an interpretable model. We explore a set of interpretable economic production models on a large empirical dataset to analyze the dynamics of content generation in knowledge markets. Amongst these, the Cobb-Douglas model best explains empirical data and provides an intuitive explanation for content generation through concepts of elasticity and diminishing returns. Content generation depends on user participation and also on how specific types of content (e.g. answers) depends on other types (e.g. questions). We show that these factors of content generation have constant elasticity—a percentage increase in any of the inputs leads to a constant percentage increase in the output. Furthermore, markets exhibit diminishing returns—the marginal output decreases as the input is incrementally increased. Knowledge markets also vary on their returns to scale—the increase in output resulting from a proportionate increase in all inputs. Importantly, many knowledge markets exhibit diseconomies of scale—measures of market health (e.g., the percentage of questions with an accepted answer) decrease as a function of number of participants. The implications of our work are two-fold: site operators ought to design incentives as a function of system size (number of participants); the market lens should shed insight into complex dependencies amongst different content types and participant actions in general social networks.</h5>
