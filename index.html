				<h1>Sustainability of Social Media Platforms: An Economic Perspective</h1>
				<h5><i><q>In an information-rich world, the wealth of information means a dearth of something else: a scarcity of whatever it is that information consumes. What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance of information sources that might consume it.</q></i> — <b>Simon, H. A. (1971)</b></h5>

				<h5>Content (post, comment, blog, wiki, photo, video, etc.) production and subsequent consumption is a key part of the social web experience. Every second, on average, several thousand tweets are tweeted on Twitter, which corresponds to several hundred million tweets per day and several hundred billion tweets per year. The content generation stats are in similar scale for other massive social media platforms such as Facebook and YouTube. We continue to witness the post-Web 2.0 era in the light of these social media platforms, where content production and consumption are the core processes that keeps the platforms <i>alive</i> by serving <i>nowness</i> in the social web experience.</h5>
				<h5>While content production and consumption are core processes that drive the social media platforms, our understanding of these processes and their relationship is yet limited. For example–What factors drive the production and consumption process in a social media platform? Is it simply user participation, implying participation of more users lead to more production and consumption? Given that the users have limited time and they are distributing their time across production and consumption activities (e.g., a Facebook user may distribute his/her time over writing his own posts and reading posts from friends), what can be inferred about the relationship between production and consumption? Further, if users are investing most of their time in consumption activities (say reading posts), or conversely, in production activities (say generating posts), how does it affect the platform's sustainability, i.e., future production and consumption?</h5>
				<h5>To date, sustainability of social media platforms has been studied mainly from the perspective of growth dynamics, with researchers emphasizing interacting population based models to explain user growth in these platforms. These models, however, only concentrate on the interaction among users, and pay little attention to the interaction between users and contents, specifically lacks attention in production and consumption. There is a recent body of empirical studies that analyze patterns of user content production to reveal useful insights. However, even with these insights, there is a "gap" in understanding the factors of production and consumption, and their relationship. What is missing from the picture is explanatory models that clearly establish the relationship between production (or consumption) and associated factors. Developing such models is important for understanding the content production and consumption proceses, predicting future production and consumption, and identifying platforms that will <i>sustain</i> for a long period of time without burning out.</h5>

				<h5>In this project, we interpret the community question answering websites on the StackExchange platform as knowledge markets, and analyze how and why these markets can fail at scale. A knowledge market framing allows site operators to reason about market failures, and to design policies to prevent them. Our goal is to provide insights on large-scale knowledge market failures through an interpretable model. We explore a set of interpretable economic production models on a large empirical dataset to analyze the dynamics of content generation in knowledge markets. Amongst these, the Cobb-Douglas model best explains empirical data and provides an intuitive explanation for content generation through concepts of elasticity and diminishing returns. Content generation depends on user participation and also on how specific types of content (e.g. answers) depends on other types (e.g. questions). We show that these factors of content generation have constant elasticity—a percentage increase in any of the inputs leads to a constant percentage increase in the output. Furthermore, markets exhibit diminishing returns—the marginal output decreases as the input is incrementally increased. Knowledge markets also vary on their returns to scale—the increase in output resulting from a proportionate increase in all inputs. Importantly, many knowledge markets exhibit diseconomies of scale—measures of market health (e.g., the percentage of questions with an accepted answer) decrease as a function of number of participants. The implications of our work are two-fold: site operators ought to design incentives as a function of system size (number of participants); the market lens should shed insight into complex dependencies amongst different content types and participant actions in general social networks.</h5>
